Arduino-based environment monitoring system that integrates multiple sensors to capture and display real-time data. It uses a DHT11 for temperature and humidity measurements, a gas sensor (MQ-series) for air quality detection, and led strip connected via a breadboard.  
Color of the leds correspond to the active sensor and the ammount of lights indicates the ammounts (middle is perfect).  
This project was made for an assignment about using an ardunio uno.
